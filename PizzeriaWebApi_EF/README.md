# üçï Tomasos Pizzeria Web API

This project is a backend Web API solution for **Tomasos Pizzeria**, an online food service that sells pizzas, pasta, and salads. The API is built with **ASP.NET Core Web API**, deployed to **Microsoft Azure**, and uses **Entity Framework Core** with **Code First** for SQL database interactions. All sensitive information is managed securely via **Azure Key Vault**.

The API is deployed to **Azure App Service**, and connected to a **SQL Azure Database**. Configuration settings and secrets are managed with **Azure Key Vault**. Swagger is enabled for testing endpoints directly in the browser.

---

## üß™ Testing

All endpoints can be tested using:

- **Swagger UI** (`/swagger`)
- **Postman** with Bearer tokens for protected routes
